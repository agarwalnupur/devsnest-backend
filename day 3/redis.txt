STREAMS (Are used to store a set of key value pairs in a pipeline which are identified via the entry key.If entry key is not given explicitly by the user i.e the user writes * instead of the entry key then redis generates the key using the current timestamp in milliseconds.)

XADD stream-name entry-key key1 value1 key2 value2 ... and so on

Example: XADD mystream 1000 name Nupur   -> 1000 is the entry key given by user

XADD stream-name MAXLEN num * key1 val1 key2 val2 -> limits the number of max num of entries in the stream to num.

XREAD STREAMS stream-name start -> to return all entries greater than start

XREAD COUNT num STREAMS stream-name start -> return num entries from the stream after entry-key = start.

XREAD BLOCK x STREAMS stream-name $ -> waits for x milliseconds to recieve any entry.

XRANGE stream-name start_entry_key end_entry_key -> returns entries in the given range in oldest entry first order

XRANGE stream-name start end COUNT num -> limit the output to num entries

XREVRANGE stream-name end start -> return output in reverse order i.e newest entries first

XRANGE stream-name - + COUNT num -> top num oldest entries first

XLEN stream-name -> returns length of stream.
