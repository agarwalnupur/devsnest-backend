    10k total user is 500 users/sec -> wix, php, wordpress (cost effective)
    1L active users -> react, node 
    more than 1L -> golang

The connection does not break while graphQL.

performance, security, edge cases

virtualisation -> send as much data as is required by the frontend. Use pagination or react virtualsation.

use encryption to send dept data.
